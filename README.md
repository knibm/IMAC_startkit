## Scope

This repository provide a simple and reusable implementation of 'Infrastructure Management as Code' as sample code.

### What is Infrastructure Management as Code ?

IaC stands for 'Infrastructure as Code' is a famous word and introduced a new way to IT operations. IaC is expected to build an IT infrastructure with Code automatically. It create a significant benefit on operations of business application. The IMaC extends the concept of Infrastructure as Code. IMaC is trying to manage the existing infrastructure. The legacy old styled Business Application Infrastructure, which cannot be built automatically by IaC, is considered as outside of scope of IaC. But, even though it could not be built by IaC, there are needs to utilize the introduced capability of IaC.

### Concept of IMaC

In case of IMaC, Idempotency is still a most important factor as like IaC. The target value of configuration management code which is represented by a `cmdb.json`. The values on `cmdb.json` will be applied to the target managed systems with IaC styled mechanism and keeping Idempotency.
